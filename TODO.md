TO-DO items

Goal: writing "echo "hello"" into our shell prints out "hello" in terminal

To get there:
[x] We can get input from user
[x] We parse the command from the input
[ ] We look for echo from environment
[ ] Once found, we pass "hello" to echo command






Other stuff for future
[ ] get env variables when shell starts and save them.
[ ] create struct that has everything needed. Paths, inputs etc...
[ ] create a function to free struct variables in the end
	[ ] paths
